# Ink-Invaders 

Game project of Ironhack's Web Developer - module 1

This first project has as a base structure the 80's Space Invaders game.

# What the game is about

The intention behind this project was to put in pratice the skills learned from the first 2 weeks of Ironhack Bootcamp, which are, the essentials of Javascript, HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation and mainly HTML Canvas.

The result is maybe still not a fun game but the learning process throughout this project was enormous, it does not mean that it will be not improved in a soon future though.
