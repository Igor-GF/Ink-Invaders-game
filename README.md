# Ink-Invaders 

Game project of Ironhack's Web Developer - module 1

This first project has as a base structure the 80's Space Invaders game.

# What the game is about

The intention behind this project was to put in pratice the skills learned from the first 2 weeks of Ironhack Bootcamp, which are, the essentials of Javascript, HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation and mainly HTML Canvas.

The result is maybe still not a fun game but the learning process throughout this project was enormous, it does not mean that it will be not improved in a soon future though.

# Further iterations

- Invaders should shoot against the player and the bullet must come from a random invader.
- The eventListeners need to be fix in the end of the game and for the start button as well.
- Music and Sounds need to be edit to reposnd better to the commands.

# Technologies used
